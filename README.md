Dailing application with Native Android SIP

This application was built to test the Android native SIP stack. The Account that needs to be registered is a account from www.getonsip.com.

To register your account in SipTester, click the "Your SIP Account" button. Now log on to your Onsip account on getonsip.com, and go the "View Profile" tab
	The following account details uses the account "john@getonsip.com" as example:
	In the "Username account" field, enter "john"
	In the "Server IP" field, enter "getonsip.com"
	In the "Password" field, enter the SIP Password as given in the "View Profile" tab on getonsip.com, NOT the password that you use to login to your account on getonsip.com.

You can then press the "Save and Return" button at the bottom. On the main screen, SIP status (shown on the stop) will show "SIP Ready" if your account has been successfully registered.

If your SIP account registration has been successful, you can dail any SIP account by entering the address in the field beneath the "Ready to Call" status. You can also receive calls as long as your application is open on your screen.
