The current view is set by the obtainMessage and sendToTarget located in 1) IncomingCallReceiver 2) SipAudioCallLis 3) SipUtilities.SipRegistrationListener

When the message is then received in DailActivity Handler, the view is appropriately set and the current mode of the call/sip registration is set

The buttons on the DailActivity screen only call methods that answer/end sipcalls, but the views are changed as soon as those methods cause
the listeners to respond to fired events

To send each message to DailActivity, static ints as declared in SipUtilities are used
Each int is associated with a state, except for the ERROR and BUSY messages, which simply shows a Toast
